Even though I am not a very good speaker in terms of giving motivation bearing motivation/light , i do have certain principles/life hacks which i believe might be at least worth sharing for.
- Give low take( people dont deserve good things just keep giving them the low )

- Be the Batman Gotham wants u to be - dont let others see the Bruce in you, show it to the people who stick enough to deserve a chance - they will also leave once u do that - True Story

- Create experiences - Always make sure that u create  them. The joy of life is not coming from delving into , but createing new experiences-
- Corollory -Dont believe ,even in the Universe

- Make ur jump decision utility set- If u ever stand on the five story / any story >1  and feel like u wanna jump, always remember about this -
-If u don't , rn u can at least smoke  a pack and die of cancer (PS: just think )
-it is always possible to relocate and rest the thought for a while till you find the much more aesthetic place to jump in -( AS I SAID SET ur utilies/priorites first)


- U need to set ur standards about how u wanna die,  for example do u need darkness/ or how much light exposure, whether it is for eg : dim street lamp enough to show the silhoutte (well this is classic), what vehicle should u need under so that u can fall right on it, could it be car not so truck enough , how much aesthetics do u need. SEE ! there are plenty to add , so at least make sure that u need to at least see 100 of such places before making that decision.( i mean utulity can be modified )
